# Introduction
This paper concludes the process we have done for our project, Beaver Neighbor Center, in the CS565 Human-Computer Interaction class in Spring term 2022. 
# Research Goal
Our project is designed as a seller-oriented trading platform for people who are in a hurry to leave Corvallis, so our project is to help those people find potential buyers and sell their products as soon as possible. Although there are many online shopping platforms existing nowadays, such as Amazon and eBay, those online shopping platforms are buyer-oriented. In other words, those platforms provide many selections for buyers to choose what to buy, and that makes it more convenient for buyers.   
However, Beaver Neighbor Center is a local-based platform designed for sellers who are graduated international students in OSU, and sellers can sell their items according to the buyersâ€™ posts or wait for the potential buyers. Our online shopping platform provides more convenience and immediacy for people to trade their items, and people do not need to waste any time and worry about any scam happening during the buy and sell transaction.
